# Farm Control

## Project Description

This application allows the management of agricultural farms, their owners, workers, and job assignments. There are two main user types: farm owners and farm workers.

Each owner can manage multiple farms, and each farm can have multiple workers and assigned jobs. The system enables registering users, managing farms, and organizing work assignments in a structured way.

The backend is built with Java and Spring Boot following RESTful best practices. Authentication is implemented using JWT Bearer tokens, and the application uses a MySQL database to persist data.
